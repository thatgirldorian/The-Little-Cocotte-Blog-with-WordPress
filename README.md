# The-Little-Cocotte-Blog-with-WordPress

<h3>Function & Description:</h3>
This is a blog revamp I did for a freelance client. She had a previous one with a wordpress.com and wanted one on wordpress.org. 
For this project, I


- used a blog-friendly layout that's neat and easy to navigate
- created some and tags categories for you
- used some sample posts to show how how they would look
- set up an author section for you as well with a description from the last blog
- set up a format that shows your latest blog posts and popular posts with an easy way to share
- added a slider that shows your featured posts
- created a logo placeholder for you


I also made a short screencast for her which shows her how to:
- create categories
- add a post to a category
- create a post
- add tags to a post
- check your comment settings (I set them up the way they were on the last one)
